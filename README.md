Iris flowering classification
This repository contains the documentation for the Iris Flower Classification project. The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques.
Introduction
The Iris flower classification problem is a classic example in machine learning. It involves classifying iris flowers into three species based on four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample has four features and a target variable (species). The dataset is available in the data folder as iris.csv.

Features:
Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Target Variable:
Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach to solve the classification problem:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and duplicates.

Normalize/standardize features.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions and relationships.

Identify patterns and correlations.

Model Selection:

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).

Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment:

Save the trained model and deploy it as a web application.
